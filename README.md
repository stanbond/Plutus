# Plutus

Plutus is an auction bidding web app where users are allowed to bid on luxurious
products they like, or sell products for other users to bid.

## Functionaliy and MVP
In this web app, users will be able to:
* Make a bid on the item you like (A google map will be used to show users where the bidding location is) or sell products for others to bid
* Inbox for enquiry where users can send or receive messages from other users
* A chatbot that can help you search items or change the language
* Image zoom in/out as well as capture on the bid product show page

## Technologies and Technical Challenges
The technologies used for this project are:
* GraphQL
* Mongoose
* Node
* Apollo
* Websocket
* Cloudinary
  
The primary technical challenges we have identified so far are:
* integrating google map into our app as well and to show the actual time before
  the bidding session ends for one product
* chatting feature and chatbot require the implementation of websocket
